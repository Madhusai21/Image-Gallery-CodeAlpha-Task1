# Responsive Image Gallery
Project Overview
This project is a Responsive Image Gallery developed as part of my internship at CodeAlpha. The gallery is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows users to view and interact with a collection of images. This project showcases my ability to create dynamic web applications with a focus on seamless navigation and an engaging user experience.
